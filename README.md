![warp-cloner](https://socialify.git.ci/totoroterror/warp-cloner/image?font=Raleway&language=1&name=1&owner=1&pattern=Circuit%20Board&stargazers=1&theme=Light)

Simple Python script that can clone [Warp Plus](https://1.1.1.1/) keys.

With this script you will be able to clone many 12-24 PB keys.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill variables (see next section)
5. Launch script using `python -u src/main.py`
6. Wait for results in console.

## Configuration

- `BASE_KEYS` (not required) - keys to clone divided by comma, if none then default keys will be used (script may not work with default keys)
- `THREADS_COUNT` (default: `1`) - amount of threads.
- `DEVICE_MODELS` (not required) - custom device model names divided by comma
- `SAVE_WIREGUARD_VARIABLES` (default: false) - should script get variables that are required to generate WireGuard config (peer ips, private / public key, endpoint)?
- `PROXY_FILE` (not required) - path to proxy file, if none then script will be launched in proxyless mode.
- `DELAY` (default: `25`) - seconds to sleep after key clone
- `OUTPUT_FILE` (default: `output.txt`) - file to append generated keys
- `OUTPUT_FORMAT` (default: `{key} | {referral_count}`) - output format (if `SAVE_WIREGUARD_VARIABLES` is set to `true`, additinal variables is available: `{private_key}`, `{peer_endpoint}`, `{peer_public_key}`, `{interface_addresses}`)
- `RETRY_COUNT` (default: 3) - how much times application will retry generation with same key
- `PUSH_API` (not required) - When a push api is specified, every time a license is successfully acquired, it will be submitted to the specified api via http post.

## Notes

### Proxy format

Proxy format for `PROXY_FILE` is `protocol://user:pass@ip:port`, example: `socks5://example.org:1892` / `http://totoro:warp@example.org`, one proxy per line.

### Getting your own 12-24 PB keys to fill BASE_KEYS

You can get your own key to start with using [@warpplus's bot](https://t.me/generatewarpplusbot) (limited to 1 key per 24 hours) or find some keys on forums.

### Properly closing application

To avoid getting error "Too many connected devices" in future, you should properly exit from the application by pressing `control` + `c` and wait for application to close (it will take ~30 seconds).

### Proxy selection

You can use almost any proxy (ipv4 / ipv6) as far as they don't block Warp API endpoint. I suggest you to use ipv6 proxy because they are way cheaper, *but keep in mind, that your network should support ipv6 in most cases to do this*.
